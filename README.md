# GlorifiedInclude
GlorifiedInclude is a module designed to be shipped with addons to automatically include files and folders so you don't have to do include each and every one individually.

# Installation
## Addons
Place the `sh_glorifiedinclude.lua` in your `autorun` folder.

## Gamemodes
You can either:
- Place the contents of `sh_glorifiedinclude.lua` at the bottom of your `shared.lua` file.
- Drag and drop `sh_glorifiedinclude.lua` into your gamemode folder and include it from your `shared.lua` file.

After that, set `IsAddon` to `false` at the top of the file.

# Usage
